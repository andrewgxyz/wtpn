# What To Play Next

A list generator to what I should be playing next by original release date (if applied in the tagging process)

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewgxyz/wtpn.git
cd wtpn
cargo build --release && cp ./target/release/wtpn ~/.local/bin
```

## NOTE

Might need to apply full dates in to release date tagging if you wanna get full use out of this utility
